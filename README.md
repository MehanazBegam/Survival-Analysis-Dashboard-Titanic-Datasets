# Survival-Analysis-Dashboard-Titanic-Dataset
This project presents an interactive Survival Analysis Dashboard built using the Titanic dataset to explore the factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster. The goal of the project is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through clear KPIs and visually intuitive charts.

## Project Objectives
-Analyze the overall survival rate of passengers -Identify key factors influencing survival -Compare survival outcomes across passenger classes -Study demographic trends such as age and gender -Evaluate the impact of fare and embarkation point on survival -Present insights through a clear and interactive dashboard

## Dataset used


# Questions (KPIs)
-What is the overall survival percentage? -How many total passengers were onboard? -How does survival vary by gender? -Which passenger class had the highest survival rate? -What is the average age by passenger class? -How does fare correlate with survival? -Which embarkation point had the most passengers? -What is the survival ratio between survived and non-survived passengers? -How does survival change across different age groups?

# Dashboard Interaction
View Dashboard

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
-Survival Percentage: 38% -Total Passengers: 891 -Number of Embarkation Points: 4 -Survival Ratio: Survived vs Not Survived -Average Survival Rate by Passenger Class -Average Fare by Passenger Class

# Process
-Data Collection Used the publicly available Titanic dataset -Data Cleaning & Preparation Handled missing values Cleaned age, fare, and embarkation data Standardized categorical variables -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Examined survival trends by class, gender, and age Analyzed fare distribution and survival probability Identified key patterns and relationships -Dashboard Design & Development Created KPIs for high-level insights Designed interactive charts and visuals Applied consistent color themes and layout -Insight Generation Interpreted visual patterns Summarized findings into actionable insights

# Dashboard

# Project Insights
-Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males -1st Class passengers showed the highest survival probability -Survival chances decreased with lower passenger class -Higher fare values were associated with better survival outcomes -Most passengers embarked from Southampton (S) -Younger passengers showed relatively higher survival trends

# Final Conclusion
The analysis reveals that gender, passenger class, and fare were the most influential factors in passenger survival. The dashboard effectively converts complex data into clear, actionable insights, making it suitable for business intelligence reporting and data analytics portfolios.
